SublimeScript
=============

## Edit Jan. 1, 2017

This is the project with which I taught myself a lot of programming. It's mostly a curiosity at this point (would be far better implemented in Python using Sublime keybindings, for one thing), but it has a special place in my heart. :)

####Automation tool for Sublime Text, Windows, and Google Chrome

SublimeScript is an EXE (compiled) or Autohotkey_L (source) script that helps you do better work in Sublime, faster.
* Italicize and bold text with the same hotkeys you use in Word. (Add hyperlinks with a hotkey, too.)
* Find and replace special characters with their HTML entities, instantly.
* Find and replace straight quotes with smart ones.
* Customize itâ€”turn off features, or map them to different keys!
